            <p>“Life is like a box of ......” just kidding. Now that I have your attention. I decided to take a bold step into a field that is as frustrating as it is gratifying. I am a competitive volleyball player and won a gold medal at the USAV Men's National volleyball tournament in 2017. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to achieve success in volleyball and I apply the same principles to my work life. I am a front end developer with a sales background. I have strong interpersonal communication skills that pair well with my technical skills and allow me to efficiently collaborate with other members of a team or work with clients.</p>
